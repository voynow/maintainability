## function: get_llm
#### args: None
The `get_llm` function is a factory method that returns a callable object, specifically a block from the block_factory. This block is configured with a template, temperature, and model name, all of which are defined in the configuration. This function is particularly useful when you need to generate a block with a specific configuration without directly interacting with the block_factory.

## function: parse_response
#### args: text
The `parse_response` function is designed to parse a string input, specifically looking for a pattern that represents a rating out of 10. It uses regular expressions to find this pattern and returns the rating as a float. If the pattern is not found or an error occurs during the parsing process, it logs the error and returns -1. This function is particularly useful when dealing with user-generated ratings or feedback that may not always follow a consistent format.

## function: get_maintainability_metrics
#### args: filepath, code
The `get_maintainability_metrics` function is designed to analyze a given piece of code and return a collection of maintainability metrics. It uses a language model to evaluate various aspects of the code, as defined in the configuration's METRIC_DESCRIPTIONS. The function then parses these responses into a more readable format, providing a comprehensive overview of the code's maintainability. This function is particularly useful for assessing the quality of code in terms of readability, complexity, and adherence to best practices.

## function: extract_metrics
#### args: user_email, project_name, session_id, filepath, content
The `extract_metrics` function is designed to extract and write maintainability metrics for a given file in a project. It takes in user email, project name, session ID, file path, and file content as arguments, and returns a transaction object with the extracted metrics. This function is particularly useful for tracking code quality over time, as it not only extracts metrics but also writes them for future reference. The function also subtly handles file extensions, defaulting to an empty string if no extension is found.

## function: validate_user
#### args: email, password
The `validate_user` function is designed to authenticate a user based on their email and password. It retrieves the user's details from the database, verifies the password, and logs any unauthorized login attempts. If the email or password is incorrect, it raises an HTTPException with a status code of 401. This function is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of user accounts.

## function: generate_new_api_key
#### args: None
This function is designed to generate a new API key. It does this by creating a random string of bytes, encoding it into a URL-safe base64 string, and then decoding it into a UTF-8 string. The function ensures the generated key is URL-safe and devoid of padding characters, making it ideal for use in web applications. <end>

## function: calculate_weighted_metrics
#### args: response_data
The function `calculate_weighted_metrics` processes a list of response data, filters out objects with invalid metrics, and calculates the weighted average of each metric based on the 'loc' (lines of code) value. It then groups these weighted averages by date. This function is particularly useful for analyzing time-series data with varying weights. It handles cases where the total 'loc' is zero by returning -1 for all metrics, thus avoiding division by zero errors.
