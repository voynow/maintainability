## function: connect_to_supabase
#### args: No arguments
The `connect_to_supabase` function is designed to establish a connection to a Supabase database. It does this by creating a client using the Supabase URL and Key, which are retrieved from the environment variables. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where the database connection needs to be established multiple times, as it simplifies the process by encapsulating the connection logic in a single function. <end>

## function: connect_to_supabase_table
#### args: table_name
The `connect_to_supabase_table` function establishes a connection to a specified table in a Supabase database. It uses environment variables to securely access the Supabase URL and key, ensuring that sensitive information is not hard-coded into the program. This function returns a Client object that can be used for further interactions with the specified table. <end>

## function: write_metrics
#### args: metrics
The `write_metrics` function is designed to connect to the 'maintainability' table in Supabase and insert the provided metrics. It returns the result of the execution. This function is particularly useful for updating the maintainability metrics in a database, providing a streamlined way to manage data updates.

## function: get_user_projects
#### args: user_email
The `get_user_projects` function is designed to retrieve a list of unique projects associated with a given user's email. It connects to a 'maintainability' table in Supabase, selects the 'project_name' field where the 'user_email' matches the provided email, and returns a list of dictionaries, each containing a unique 'project_name'. If no projects are associated with the user's email, it returns an empty list. This function is particularly useful for quickly identifying all projects a user is involved in.

## function: get_metrics
#### args: user_email, project_name
The `get_metrics` function retrieves all the maintainability metrics for a specific user's project from a Supabase table. It uses the user's email and project name as filters to ensure the correct data is returned. This function is particularly useful when you need to quickly access and analyze the maintainability metrics of a specific project.

## function: write_user
#### args: email, hashed_password, role
The `write_user` function is designed to create a new user entry in the 'users' table of a Supabase database. It takes in an email, a hashed password, and an optional role (default is 'user'), and returns a tuple containing the results of the operation. This function is particularly useful for managing user data securely, as it ensures that only hashed passwords are stored.

## function: get_user
#### args: email
The `get_user` function retrieves a user's information from the 'users' table in a Supabase database using the user's email address. It returns a dictionary containing the user's email, password, and role if the user exists, otherwise it returns None. This function is particularly useful for user authentication and role-based access control in web applications.

## function: api_key_exists
#### args: api_key
The function `api_key_exists` checks if a given API key exists in the 'api_keys' table of a Supabase database. It establishes a connection to the table, performs a select operation to find the API key, and returns a boolean value indicating the presence of the key. This function is particularly useful in validating API keys before processing requests.

## function: write_api_key
#### args: api_key, user, name, creation_date, status
The `write_api_key` function is designed to store API key data into a Supabase table. It takes in five parameters: the API key, user, name, creation date, and status, and inserts this data into the 'api_keys' table. The function returns the result of the execution, which can be useful for error handling or confirmation of successful insertion.

## function: list_api_keys
#### args: email
This function retrieves all active API keys associated with a given user's email from a Supabase table named 'api_keys'. It establishes a connection with the table, performs a select operation to fetch all records matching the user's email and status 'active', and returns the data. If no data is found, it returns an empty list.

## function: delete_api_key
#### args: api_key
The `delete_api_key` function is designed to remove a specific API key from the 'api_keys' table in a Supabase database. It does this by changing the status of the specified API key to 'deleted', rather than completely removing the record. This function is useful for maintaining a record of all API keys, even those that are no longer active.

## function: write_log
#### args: loc, text
The `write_log` function is designed to write logs into a Supabase table named 'logs'. It takes two arguments: a location and a text, and inserts these as a new record in the table. The function returns the result of the execution, which can be useful for error handling or confirmation of successful log entry.

## function: get_email_via_api_key
#### args: api_key
The function `get_email_via_api_key` is designed to retrieve the associated user email from a Supabase table using a given API key. It connects to the 'api_keys' table in Supabase, performs a select operation to find the user associated with the provided API key, and returns the user's email if found. If no associated user is found, the function returns None. This function is particularly useful when you need to identify a user based on their API key.
