{'app.py': 'To calculate the maintainability of the code, we can use a code analysis tool such as a static code analyzer or a code complexity tool. These tools can provide metrics and scores that indicate the maintainability of the code.\n\nHowever, without access to the specific implementation of the `block_factory` and `blocks` modules, it is not possible to accurately determine the maintainability of the code. The maintainability of the code also depends on factors such as code organization, modularity, and adherence to coding best practices.\n\nTo improve the maintainability of the code, you can consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. Use meaningful variable and function names: Clear and descriptive names can make the code more readable and easier to understand.\n\n2. Break down complex functions: If a function is too long or has multiple responsibilities, consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions. This can improve code readability and maintainability.\n\n3. Add comments and documentation: Documenting the code with comments and docstrings can help other developers understand the purpose and functionality of the code.\n\n4. Handle exceptions gracefully: Instead of using a generic exception handler, consider handling specific exceptions and providing meaningful error messages or logging information.\n\n5. Use consistent coding style: Follow a consistent coding style throughout the codebase. This can make the code easier to read and maintain.\n\n6. Remove unused code: Remove any unused imports, variables, or functions to reduce clutter and improve code maintainability.\n\n7. Write unit tests: Adding unit tests can help ensure the correctness of the code and make it easier to refactor or modify in the future.\n\nBy following these suggestions and using code analysis tools, you can improve the maintainability of the code.'}
